From the main OverTheWire (OTW) bandit site, go ahead and click on Level 0 on the left hand side to get started.

The challenge reads:

To secure shell (ssh) into bandit.labs.overthewire.org we would normally:

ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org 

But... we need to add the follwing from the challenge description:
  Port: 2220
  Username: Bandit0

Reading the man page for ssh:
```
ssh connects and logs into the specified hostname (with optional user name). The user must prove 
his/her identity to the remote machine using one of several methods depending on 
the protocol version used... 
```

To specifiy the user (from the ssh manpage):
```
-l login_name
Specifies the user to log in as on the remote machine.
```

To specificy the port (from the ssh manpage):
```
-p port#
Specifies the port to log into
```
Combining the two, we get the solution:

# Solution:

```
BurntxN00dle@ubuntu:~$ ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit0
```
You may be asked ```Are you sure you want to continue connecting?``` Just type ```yes```

Afterwards, we will be prompted for the password, and we know from the challenge description the password
is simply ```bandit0``` typing that in gets us in!

That's it for this challenge! Afterall, the goal of this challenge was to get us familiarized how to connect using 
ssh and to get us logged in into the game.

To proceed to the next challenge, stay on the ssh, and click on the ```Level 0 -> 1``` on the left hand side
of the OTW bandit website.
