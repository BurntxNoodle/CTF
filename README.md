## CTF
I am currently learning how to CTF by doing some challenges, reading writeups,
and writing my own writeups with what I learned.

I will be posting CTF writeups, summaries of challenges, guides, notes, etc.
This repository will also contain wargames such as OverTheWire and pwnable.kr

Some helpful resources:  
- [CTF101](https://ctf101.org/) (Provides some great reading on types of challenges encountered at CTFs)
- [Archive of CSAW CTF Challenges](https://365.csaw.io/) (Past challenges)
- [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/) (Lists upcomming CTF competitions and some writeups)  

### still a work in progress
